Concept: An alternative to vanilla tech advancement, allowing the player to scale into the lategame while maintaining a tribal/medieval feel. Fueled by psychics instead of electricity.

What do vanilla tech levels provide?
	Industrial:
		Improved weapons (4 or 5 levels)
		Improved armor (1 level)
		Automated defenses
		Reduced work (electric buildings instead of fueled)
		Improved medicine (medicine + hospital buildings)
		Improved mobility (drop pods, tons of modded content)
		Recreation (TV)
		Climate control
		Food preservation
		Prosthetics
		Resource location (ground scanner, long-range mineral scanner)
		Genetics (with Biotech)
		Workers/guards (with Biotech)
	Spacer:
		Improved weapons (1 level)
		Improved armor (3 tiers)
		Shields
		Bionics
		Space flight

What content do popular medieval mods add, that I don't want to duplicate?
	VFE: Medieval 2
		Weapon and armor variety (medieval)
		Potions/alchemy
	Medieval Overhaul
		Weapon and armor variety (medieval)
		Jewelry
		Food preservation

Content ideas:

	General theme: path of body / path of mind. 
		-One set of gear that scales with psychic sensitivity but makes you worse at psycasting (lowers psyfocus / neural heat?). 
			-Native American (Eastern US) styled gear
		-The other strengthens psycasting but maybe consumes neural heat?
		-Eventually culminate in path of soul with combines the two with no downsides



	Prosthetics
		-Bioferrite
			
		-Jade

		-Eltex
		-High tier: scale with no penalty

	Factions
		-Witches of the Mind
			-
		-Witches of the Body
			-

	Voidwalking for long-distance travel
		-Gather caravan and move to "void tunnel" map. Map is based on metal hell, periodic attacks by anomaly monsters. Must get from one side to the other to complete travel. Map gets longer the further away the destination tile is.
		-Ritual to find void resources, how to make this more interesting? Summon a chunk of void to your map, possibly with monsters?
