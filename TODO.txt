Content ideas:

	General theme: path of body / path of mind. Gear that scales with psychic sensitivity but lowers it, gear that increases psychic sensitivity but weakens the user
		-the two paths finally merge into the path of soul, gear that scales on psy but also improves it

	Low tier:
	Armor with values that scale on psy, lower it
	Apparel that increase psy, but have downsides

	Mid tier:
	Armor with shield that produces neural heat

	High tier:
	Advanced version that replenishes shield when neural heat increases

	Weapons with damage that scales on psychic sensitivity
		-Anima + Jade
	Weapons that scale with psychic sensitivity and also have special abilities
		-Eltex + Jade

	Prosthetics
		-Bioferrite
			
		-Jade

		-Eltex
		-High tier: scale with no penalty

	Factions
